INTRODUCTION
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper. usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides with the wiper, the driver's view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear. Wipers do have a very important role in the safety of the drivers because wiper performance is closely releated to the safety of driving. If it is rains a lot and the car does'nt use wipers windshield will be dewy. Visible dew on the glass will block the view of the driver. When the driver's view is hindered, the risk of an accident is very high. This makes the wipers a very important car enchancement and must be present on all types of vehicles.

HISTORY
By 1917 John Oeishi formed the Tri-Continental Corporation later to become Trico, one of the largest manufacturers of windshield wipers in the world. the windshield wiper had reached mass production phase! By the early 1920s, the hand-cranked wiper had been replaced by a system that uses engine vacuum to drive the mechanism. Vacuum Wipers were great, except that their speed would vary according to engine load and speed. By the early 60s vacuum wipers were replaced by an electric drive, and in the mid-60s. teh intermittent wiper was invented (and was initially rejected by Ford).
