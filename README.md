## M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM


 The Wiper speed control system controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition. It cleans 
 raindrops or any other liquids off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required mannual wiper activation, and the 
 operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage. As a result, this method is proposed to address this issue.
 The project's goals are to improve ageing the automobile systems by giving automated transmission. Most of the cars 
 have two wipers, one on the rear window and other on the front glass. The wipers parts visible from the cars are the 
 rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. the warn gear 
 is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move. Now a days we have 
 the automated control wiper system whenever we stop wiping in between the process it will automatically come to initial 
 position this is the new wiper system behind the wiper arm. This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing 
 conventional wipers.



## Guidelines
* Use STM32cube IDE software for simulation purpose and for coding purpose use the visual studio code.
* Return appropriate results from all the functions.
* Follow Modular programming and multifile approach
* Create Makefile with targets for compiling and testing, analysis and coverage.
* Follow best practices while writing the code.
